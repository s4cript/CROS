# CORS Exploitation 


**What is CORS vulnerability?**

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control and restrict web page scripts from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. CORS is designed to prevent a potential security vulnerability known as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and protect sensitive data on the web.

CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a set of rules implemented by web browsers to manage requests made between different origins (domains). An "origin" typically consists of the combination of protocol (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), domain (e.g., example.com), and port (e.g., :80 or :443).

CORS works by including specific HTTP headers in server responses that inform the browser whether it should allow or deny web page scripts from accessing resources on a different origin. These headers include "Access-Control-Allow-Origin," "Access-Control-Allow-Methods," and others, which specify which origins are permitted to access the resources, what HTTP methods are allowed, and additional constraints.

By enforcing these rules, CORS helps prevent potentially malicious websites from making unauthorized requests to other domains on behalf of users, protecting user data and web security. However, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in CORS settings can lead to security risks, such as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks or data exposure. Properly configuring CORS headers is essential for maintaining the security of web applications.
